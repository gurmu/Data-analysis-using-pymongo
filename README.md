PyMongo is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python. Objects retrieved from MongoDB through PyMongo are compatible with dictionaries and lists, so they're easily printable, iterable, and manipulable. Whether you're crunching numbers or spinning up JSON APIs, working with MongoDB Data is intuitive and productive. pymongo's BSON classes provided a more JSON-like behavior for accessing data in MongoDB. In this lesson, we demonstrate several mongodb queries for data preparation and visualization.
